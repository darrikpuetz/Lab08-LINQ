# Lab 8 LINQ Hoods
*Author: Darrik Puetz*

----

## Description
For this assignment we needed to read a json file and convert it into classes by using the properties that came with the json file. Then we used that data to drill deeper into formatted queries. 

Each query builds off of the prior query. You should be chaining.

Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)
Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)
